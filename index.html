        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, and firstly thank you for visiting my 3D website! I appreciate it. Anywho, my name is Noah and I am a 22 year old full-stack web developer with about 1 1/2 years experience. I began my coding education through Lambda School, which honestly wasn't all too pleasant. But, they did help me understand the fundementals of JavaScript, Less, React, Axios, SQL, Node, Yup, Cypress.io, Jest, Insomnia, Express, Morgan, Helmet, Knex, and JWTs, as well as mentoring younger students to help them understand concepts. Besides coding, I have many other hobbies and if you're interested, check out my Hobbies panel located at the bottom of this website! If you're interested in my recent coding projects, be sure to check my Projects panel located right below this one.

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <p>
          My "mock" <a target="_blank" href="https://phonestore-bay.vercel.app/">Phone Store</a> is one of my most recent projects. The store is built using only ReactJS (besides styling, which included minimal React Bootstrap, but mostly my own CSS). Honestly, this project was a lot of fun! When you first open the app, you're presented with an array of unique products available to "purchase". You can either click on the product, which will take you to a "details" page for the specific product you're interested in, or you can "add" the product to your cart in the lower-right corner. After shopping around you can check your cart, where you can see how much you owe (tax included!). However, if the total price is too high, don't stress! You can either remove individual products from your cart, or clear it entirely.

        <p>
          This real-time <a target="_blank" href="https://cryptotracker-sigma.vercel.app/">Crypto Tracker</a> communicates with an API to retrieve and display the image, name, symbol, price, volume, any price changes, as well as the market cap for present-day cryptocurrencies. This neat app was again made with ReactJS, as well as Axios for retrieving the JSON data. If your friend is freaking out about a cryptocurrency and you have no idea why, utilize the search feature to quickly pull up that currency to understand why he's jumping up and down so much.

        <p>
          Are you falling behind schedule constantly? Are you wondering "If only there was a way to organize my daily tasks"? Well, do I have an app for you! My guaranteed-to-work <a target="_blank" href="https://task-manager-seven-rho.vercel.app/">Task Manager</a> was built for this exact purpose! This colorful task management app allows you to add unlimited daily tasks, edit any of them for whatever reason, as well as crossing out the tasks you've completed AND remove individual tasks so you know how much you've accomplished during the day! Pretty neat huh? Tip: Clicking on the text of the task will cross out the text.

        <h3>Drones</h3>
        <p>
          In August of 2021 I'll be moving from my hometown of Madison, Wisconsin to Seattle, Washington. Since we'll be driving the entire way, I thought I'd build an FPV drone from scratch. Prior to spending about $1k on the equiptment I'd need, I started on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdekx7KI4Q8">virtual flight simulator</a> to see if I would be any good at flying my creation. About 30 hours in, I was being told I was on par skill-wise with other pilots with 3+ years experience. After many comments, I decided to bite the bullet and make <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEPs6s8Hm-U">this</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
          Back in the middle school days, I was apart of orchestra and choir. Though those classes weren't particularly interesting to me, making music was. From 8th grade to senior year, I taught myself FL Studio, a music production software where I would make quick <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/timothyalan/stop-being-in-your-feelings">"type beats"</a> in 5 minutes, trying to capture the emotion of whatever I was feeling as fast as I could. During this time, I also taught myself how to play the piano, as well as the cello and electric guitar. In freshmen to sophmore year of college, I would teach myself how to produce on the softwares Logic Pro X as well as Ableton. During this time I would sometimes produce music for local artists, like <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/timothyalan/brenna-into-you-prod-by-noah">Into You by Brenna Lynn</a>. If you're interested, you may listen to my most recent project <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/thatneukid/vaporwave">ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ ラルス</a>, which took me a day to produce and mix, and it's original intent was for an advertisement for my old skateboard company.
        </p>
        <h3>Film</h3>
        <p>
          This ties directly with my drone stuff, as I attach cinema-quality cameras on my drone setup, fly around get some clips, and edit videos in Adobe Premiere, which is a software for editing videos (which I have about 6 years experience with). Unfortunately I have nothing to show off as of now, but I am hoping to create a compilation of footage after my big move.
